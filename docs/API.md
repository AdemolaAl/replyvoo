# Replyvoo API reference

Generated from `src/routes/*.js`. All JSON endpoints live under `/api/`. The dashboard and admin panel use exactly these endpoints, so anything the UI can do, you can do with the API.

## Conventions

- **Base URL**: your `APP_URL`, e.g. `https://replyvoo.com`.
- **Auth**: a session cookie `rv_s` (HttpOnly) set by sign-up, login, password reset or invite accept. Send it back with every request (`credentials: 'same-origin'` in the browser, `-b cookies.txt` with curl).
- **CSRF header**: every `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` to `/api/*` must send `x-rv: 1`. Without it: `403 {"error":"Missing request header"}`.
- **Body**: send `content-type: application/json`. Max body 6 MB.
- **Errors**: non-2xx status with `{ "error": "Human readable message", "code"?: "..." }`. In production, 5xx errors always say "Something went wrong. Please try again."
- **Common statuses**: `400` bad input, `401` not logged in / wrong password, `402` limit reached or not enough credits (with `code`), `403` not allowed / feature switched off / workspace suspended, `404` not found, `409` already exists, `413` body too large, `429` rate limited, `502` provider (Telegram, Paystack, Flutterwave) refused, `503` maintenance mode.
- **Auth levels** used below:
  - **Public** – no login.
  - **User** – logged in.
  - **Member** – logged in and a member of an *active* workspace (the current workspace from the session).
  - **Manager** – Member with workspace role `owner` or `admin` (not `agent`).
  - **Admin** – user with `role = admin`.
- **Rate limits** are per IP and listed where they apply ("RL 10/h").

Example (log in, then call the API):

```bash
curl -c jar.txt -H 'x-rv: 1' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"demo@replyvoo.com","password":"demo12345"}' https://your-domain/api/auth/login
curl -b jar.txt https://your-domain/api/app/bootstrap
```

### Closers

| Method & path | Auth | Body / notes | Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/app/closers` | Member | Each item also has `score` (0–100), `gaps` (open gap count) and `knowledge_items`. | `[closer]` |
| `POST /api/app/closers` | Manager | `{ name, template, persona: {tone, length, emoji (0–100), color?: '#RRGGBB'}, skills: {paylink, vision, upsell, nudge, handoff, receipt}, instructions (≤4000), knowledge (free-text notes, ≤60000), pay_link (https://…), pro_brain, rules?, active? (false = created paused, used by the Training Coach), channel_id? }`. First Closer sends the **closer-launched** email. Saves version 1. | `closer` · 402 `code: closer_limit` · 400 bad pay link |
| `PUT /api/app/closers/:id` | Manager | Any of the fields above. `{ active: bool }` alone just pauses/resumes. `channel_id` assigns a channel to it. Every save stores a version (last 10 kept). | `closer` · 404 |
| `DELETE /api/app/closers/:id` | Manager | Unassigns it from channels and threads, then deletes (knowledge and versions cascade). | `{ ok }` |
| `POST /api/app/closers/preview` | Member · RL 40/h | Closer fields (the unsaved draft, incl. `rules`) + `message`, `history: [{role, text}]`. With `closer_id` the Closer's saved structured knowledge is used (404 if it isn't yours).

Nothing is billed. | `{ text, handoff, demo, sources: [{id, kind, label, score}], used: {id, kind} \| null, check?: {pass, note} }` |
| `POST /api/app/closers/slot` | Manager | Buys an extra Closer slot for 30 days with credits (`billing.extra_closer_credits`). | `{ ok }` · 402 `code: no_credits` |

`closer = { id, name, template, persona, skills, instructions, knowledge, rules, pay_link, pro_brain, active, replies, created_at, updated_at, channels: [{id, type, name, username}] }`

`rules = { do: [str], dont: [str], avoid: [str], required: [str], discount: { mode: 'knowledge'|'never'|'max', max: 1–90 }, handoff: { angry, refund, human, legal: bool, order_over: number (0 = off), keywords: [str] }, hours: str, language: { mode: 'auto'|'force', lang }, set: bool }` (lists ≤15 items; cleaned by `training.cleanRules`).

### Agent Studio training (`src/routes/studio.js`)

Body: a Telegram `Update`. Response `{ ok: true }`. Updates with an `update_id` not higher than the last one seen are ignored. You never set this URL by hand: the dashboard sets it when a bot is connected.

### POST /webhooks/paystack
Header `x-paystack-signature` = HMAC-SHA512 of the raw body using `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`. Bad/missing → `401 {"error":"Bad signature"}`. On `charge.success` the order `data.reference` is verified with Paystack and fulfilled. Response `{ ok: true }`.

### POST /webhooks/flutterwave
Header `verif-hash` must equal `FLUTTERWAVE_WEBHOOK_HASH`. Bad/missing → 401. The order `data.tx_ref` is verified with Flutterwave and fulfilled. Response `{ ok: true }`.

### POST /webhooks/gatevoo
Header `X-Gatevoo-Signature: t=<unix>,v1=<hex HMAC-SHA256(GATEVOO_WEBHOOK_SECRET, "<t>.<raw body>")>`, at most 5 minutes old. Bad/missing → 401. The order `data.reference` is re-checked with `GET /invoices/:id` on Gatevoo before it's fulfilled. Response `{ ok: true }`. Full contract: `docs/GATEVOO.md`.

### Gatevoo admin and sandbox
- `GET /api/admin/gatevoo`: mode (`live`/`sandbox`/`off`), coins, webhook URL. `POST /api/admin/gatevoo/test` pings Gatevoo. Both need **Pricing** access.
- `POST /api/admin/orders/:ref/check`: asks the provider (Gatevoo, Paystack, Flutterwave) for the latest state. Needs **Orders** edit access.
- `GET/POST /pay/gatevoo/:ref`: sandbox payment page (only with no Gatevoo keys and `PAYMENTS_DEMO=true`; workspace members only).

## 6. Links and pages – `src/routes/links.js`, `src/routes/pages.js`

HTML and redirects (not JSON).

| Method & path | What it does |
|---|---|
| `GET /r/:code` | Voo Squad referral link. Sets `rv_ref` cookie (30 days), counts a `ref` click, redirects to `/?ref=CODE`. |
| `GET /go/joinvoo?from=place` | Counts a `joinvoo` click with the source, redirects to `joinvoo.url` + UTM tags + `utm_content=place`. |
| `GET /pay/callback?ref=` (also `reference`, `tx_ref`) | Return page after Paystack/Flutterwave. Verifies the order, then redirects to `/app/wallet?order=REF`. |
| `GET /pay/demo/:ref` | Demo checkout page (only when `PAYMENTS_DEMO` is on and you belong to the order's workspace). |
| `POST /pay/demo/:ref` | "Pay" button of the demo page. Same-origin check, fulfils, redirects to `/app/wallet?order=REF`. |
| `GET /unsubscribe?e=email&t=signature` | One-click unsubscribe from broadcasts (`marketing_opt_out = 1`). |
| `GET /app`, `GET /app/*` | Dashboard single-page app shell (`views/app.html`). Client routes include `/app/login`, `/app/signup`, `/app/forgot`, `/app/reset`, `/app/verify`, `/app/invite`, `/app/live`, `/app/inbox`, `/app/leads`, `/app/closers`, `/app/studio`, `/app/channels`, `/app/blast`, `/app/juno`, `/app/wallet`, `/app/plan`, `/app/squad`, `/app/joinvoo`, `/app/team`, `/app/settings`. |
| `GET /admin`, `GET /admin/*` | Admin single-page app shell (`views/admin.html`). |
| `GET /` | Homepage (`?lang=en|fr|pt|es|sw|ar`, `?ref=CODE`). |
| `GET /pricing` | Pricing page. |

| `GET /telegram-ai-chatbot`, `/whatsapp-ai-chatbot`, `/instagram-dm-automation`, `/tiktok-dm-automation`, `/messenger-ai-chatbot` | Channel landing pages. Status comes from `flags.channels` (Telegram = live if any of its three flags is live). `off` → 404. `soon` → waitlist form (`POST /api/public/waitlist { email, item: '<channel id>' }`) plus "Start on Telegram today"; `live` → "Start free". Copy in `views/site/channel-content.js`. |
| `GET /blog/rss.xml` | RSS 2.0 feed of the latest 20 published posts (404 when the `blog` feature is off). |

| `GET /healthz` | `{ ok: true, time }`. Use for uptime checks. Note: returns the 503 page while maintenance mode is on. |

## 5. Website widget – `src/routes/widget.js` (public, cross-origin)

Called by `public/widget.js` from customers' websites. **Not** under `/api/`, so the `x-rv` header is not needed and no cookies are used. Every route except images checks that `Origin` (or `Referer`) is one of the widget's domains (plus `localhost` outside production) and answers CORS with that exact origin. Errors are JSON `{ error, code? }`. Full behaviour: docs/WEBSITE_WIDGET.md.

| Method & path | Body / query | Response |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /widget.js` | – | The embeddable script (static file, cached 1 h in production). Install: `<script src="APP_URL/widget.js" data-key="wk_..." async></script>` |
| `OPTIONS /w/:key/:what` | CORS preflight | 204 with `Access-Control-Allow-*` for allowed origins · 403 otherwise |
| `GET /w/:key/config` | RL 300/10 min per IP | `{ key, online, offline_reason, business, closer: {name, initials, ai}, widget: {...look, texts, behaviour, lead}, font: {family, css}, assets: {logo?, avatar?, launcher?}, team_online, telegram_url, branding: {show, url}, css }` (no domains, tokens or ids). Records `install.host/seen_at` (max once a minute). · 403 `origin_not_allowed` · 404 |
| `POST /w/:key/messages` | `{ visitor_id, text, page_url?, page_title? }` – `visitor_id` matches `/^v_[A-Za-z0-9]{16,40}$/`, text 1–1,000 chars. RL 30/10 min per visitor, 200/h per IP. | `{ reply: {id, author:'ai', text, created_at} \| null, delay_ms, typing_ms, handoff, human, team_online, last_id }`. `reply` is null when a human took over, AI is off, no Closer, or no credits; the widget then polls. · 400 · 403 · 429 · 503 `{offline:true}` (flag not live, workspace suspended or plan limit) |
| `GET /w/:key/messages?visitor_id=&after=` | Polling (every 4 s while open) | `{ messages: [{id, author:'ai'\|'human', text, created_at}], human, handoff, online }` – only that visitor's thread, outgoing messages after `after`. |
| `POST /w/:key/lead` | `{ visitor_id, name?, email?, phone?, identify? }` – required fields follow the widget's lead settings (`identify: true` from `Replyvoo.identify()` skips them). RL 10/h per visitor. | `{ ok }` – updates the contact (name, email, phone, warm/qualified), adds a note to the thread and an event `lead` "New website lead". · 400 `{field}` · 503 |
| `GET /w/:key/asset/:kind` | `kind` = logo, avatar, launcher | The image with its stored type, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`, cached 1 day (URLs carry `?v=`). · 404 |

Website conversations appear in the dashboard API like any other: `GET /api/app/threads` (`channel_type: 'website'`), `GET /api/app/threads/:id` (adds `page: {url, title, created_at}` – the last page the visitor wrote from), `GET /api/app/contacts` (now with `email`, `phone`), `GET /api/app/export`. `GET /api/app/bootstrap` adds `usage.website: {sites, used, slots, remove_branding, custom_css}` and `widget_catalog: {presets, fonts, defaults}`. Notifications include type `lead`.
